            This was the final project for CS225, data structures and algorithms in C++. 
            There was a group of 4 people, including me, who worked on this project.
            We were unsure of how and where to start the project because everyone was busy and felt a little pressured by the deadline of the project each week.
            We brainstormed and agreed on working a project where we can find the shortest path of california road network with public data source.
            Everyone contributed significantly to the project. Personally, I created the entire structure of the project, including setting up branches and guiding teammates through, 
            and implemented Dijkstra's algorithm.
