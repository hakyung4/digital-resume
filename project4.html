            Once I started learning Next.js, I immediately fell in love with it.
            I wanted to use it to create my own blog where I can post and share whatever I want.
            I am planning on using this blog to share many different topics such as my programming journey and my trip.
            I was also excited to learn new skills such GraphQL and GraphCMS, which made my life easier.
            I am excited to do more project using Next.js! 
            (I might write some of my posts in Korean)
