            This is the first MERN stack app I built. It is a simple web app that allows users to set and delete goals. 
            All data is stored in MongoDB, and sensitive information such as password is protected by using built-in modules 
            such as bcrypt. As you can see, it has a very simple design and minimum feature.
            Regardless, it has all the eseential functionalities such as user authentication and CRUD functionalities.

            <li>Express.js</li>
